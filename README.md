## Motivation

Heavily inspired by the work of [formkit](https://formkit.com/) and [headless ui](https://headlessui.com/), I wanted to take these two approaches and provide a very simple, lightweight form authoring framework that gave you full control on styling, while providing the power of error handling, validation and form submission.

Save time not having to build out the boilerplate code required for your base components and just focus on styling.

### Why not use formkit?

FormKit solves allot of problems and is a fantastic framework, if you don't have a heavily customised design system and can use most of the components out of the box with some customisation, then i recommend formkit over this framework.

Vue-forms was designed to be simple and lightweight, perfectly paired with tailwind.
